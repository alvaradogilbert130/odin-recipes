    <h1>Pizza Crazy</h1>
    <p>Pizza, in its modern form, originated in Naples, Italy, evolving from earlier flatbreads with toppings that were popular in ancient cultures. The word "pizza" itself has been recorded since 997 AD in southern Italy. Modern pizza, featuring tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings, emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries in Naples, becoming a staple for the working class. Raffaele Esposito is often credited with creating the "Margherita" pizza in 1889, dedicated to Queen Margherita, and it was the first to include cheese</p>
